# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a React Native project that utilizes asynchronous storage to manage user data locally. It leverages the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` package to provide a secure and efficient way to store key-value pairs for persistent data storage across app sessions.

## Installation
To get started with the User Workspace project, follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd user-workspace
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   You can install the required packages using npm or yarn. Use one of the following commands:
   - With npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - With yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start the project using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or, for yarn users:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the Metro bundler and you can begin developing or testing the app on a simulator or physical device.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Storage:** Utilizes React Native's Async Storage for storing user preferences and significant data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Data Persistence:** Ensures user data remains intact even after the app is closed or the device is restarted.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependency as specified in the `package.json`:

- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage:** A community-maintained library for asynchronous key-value storage in React Native apps.

To view more about the dependencies, check the `package.json` file in the project root.
